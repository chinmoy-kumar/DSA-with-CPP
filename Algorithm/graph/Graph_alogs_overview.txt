# Single Source Shortest Distance
===================================
BFS graph: 
    - Doesn't works for weighted graph.
    - Time complexity: O(V + E)

Dijkstra: 
    - Only works for single source graph
    - Doesn't work if negative weighted cycle is present in graph.
    - Time complexity: O(ElogV)

Bellman-ford:
    - Only works for single source graph
    - Time complexity is worse than Dijkstra but can handle negative weighted cycle.
    - Time complexity: O(V x E)

# All Pair Shortest Distance
=================================
Floyd-warshall
    - Time complexity: O(v^3)
