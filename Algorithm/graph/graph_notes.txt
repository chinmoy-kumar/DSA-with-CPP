# Types of Graphs
    -Direction
        1. Directed
        2. Undirected
    -Weight 
        1. Weighted (it can be many thing in real life like distance, time, cost etc)
        2. Unweighted
    -Cycle
        1. Cyclic
        2. Acyclic

# Ways of taking input in Graphs
    -Adjacency Matrix
    -Adjacency List
    -Edge List

# Which one used for what?
    - Check 2 nodes are connected or not: Adjacency matrix
    - All the connected nodes from a node: Adjacency list
    - To get the edges and no need of connections: Edge list
