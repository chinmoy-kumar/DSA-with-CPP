What is Stack?

=> Stack is a Data Structure that follows LIFO techniques which means data is inserted at the top and also removed from the top.

We use a stack when you need to manage data in a way where the last item added is the first one to be removed. 

Stack Feature
    - Abstract Data Structure
    - Higher level Data Structure

NOTE:
    1) We can not access the next value of stack without delete or pop the previous vale.
    2) We alawys need to check if the stack is empty or not using empty() function before using top() or pop() fucntion.
